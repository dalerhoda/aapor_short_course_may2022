# Samplics: Survey Sampling from A to Z in Python

**Instructor**: Mamadou Saliou Diallo

**Abstract**: Survey samples are often selected using predefined probabilistic methods from finite populations. Complex sampling designs are used to facilitate fieldwork and keep costs under control (e.g., stratification, clustering, stage sampling, etc.), resulting in samples with unequal selection probabilities. Techniques such as sample selection, weight adjustment, and sample analysis need to account for the complexity of the sampling design. I developed a Python package named samplics, which implements sample size calculation, sample selection, population parameter estimation, and small area prediction to allow Python users to work with survey data more efficiently. 

This course will show how a survey statistician can use Python and, more specifically, samplics to conduct a comprehensive survey. More specifically, I will show how to calculate sample size, use SRS and PPS techniques to select samples, calculate and adjust sample weights, estimate linear and non-linear population parameters using Taylor-based and replication-based techniques, including calibration techniques such as GREG, post-stratification, raking. In addition, I will illustrate regression techniques under the complex sampling design using samplics. Finally, if time allows, I will introduce conducting basic small area estimation (SAE) methods using samplics.
